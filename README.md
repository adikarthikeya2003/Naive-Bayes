# Naive-Bayes

This repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with strong independence assumptions.

## Features:

Implementation of Naive Bayes for classification tasks.

Supports different variants: Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

Step-by-step code with detailed comments for clarity.

Includes sample datasets for demonstration and testing.

Visualization of class probabilities and decision boundaries (if applicable).

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (optional, for comparisons or utilities)

## Applications:

Text classification tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis.

Medical diagnosis using probabilistic models.

Understanding Bayesian inference and conditional probabilities in machine learning.
